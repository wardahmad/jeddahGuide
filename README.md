## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to navigate through different pages using the navigation menu.
* As a user, I should have the ability to click on an item on the navigation menu to be shown a list that corresponds to the item I clicked on.
* As a user, I should be able to click on an item/place of the currently viewed list to get more information about that item/place.
* As a user, I should be shown a map that points to the location of the place I chose to be displayed


## How it Works
### ``` App.js```
The main component rendered by ``` index.js```. It handles the display of the main navigation bar that allows the user to choose the type of place they wish to see a list of, whether it's a restaurant, cafe, hotel, a place or an activity. As well as taking care of the defining the routes to each one of the components responsible for displaying the corresponding list of places, which will be achieved when the user clicks on the link associated with that place.

### Components 
The application has 6 other components:
* ``` NavbarMain ```
<br> Returns the main bar shown at the very top of the website. Which includes the application name and logo, as well as a link to the homepage.
* ``` Footer ```
<br> Handles the display of a footer at the bottom of the webpage.
* ``` List ```
<br>Responsible for displaying the list it recieves from ``` App.js``` through routing. The list recieved as props can be a list of restaurants, cafes, places, hotels or activities.
<br>The main purpose of each one of the components is to show a list of choices and enable the user to click on a specific item to display more information about it.
* ``` Display ```
<br> Displays information of the place/item chosen by the user from any of the previous components where it'll be rendered.
* ``` Show Carousel ```
<br> Rendered by the ``` Display ``` component to show multiple images of the currently displayed place/item using ``` Bootstrap Carousel ``` as part of the inormation related to that place.
* ``` Map ```
Rendered by the ```Display ``` component, it handles showing a map pointing to the location of the currently displayed item/place as a marker on that map using Bing Maps API.
